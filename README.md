That team is now added to the database, and you are brought to a page that lists all of the players from that team. From the multiple select field, choose player(s) and press Add players to add these players to the database.

On the "See all saved players" page you have the ability for each player to delete from the db. To create a custom team, select the appropriate link, and on the page that appears enter a custom team name and select player(s) that are saved to the db you'd like to add to your team and press Create team. You are then brought to the "View your custom teams" page. You are given the option for each custom team to rename it. To do so, select "Rename," enter the new name and press "update name."
